            Anime is a term refering to animation that originates from Japan. Most anime are adaptations of different types of
            manga. These are similar to western comic books; however, it could be argued that
            anime reaches a broader range of topics and sub-generes.

                So you've gone and watched all the anime to exist ever in the world now. You are a true weeb.
                There is only one problem. You were supposed to be working. Go get a job. The same phrase you hear 
                day in and day out from your close friends and family. They are all worried about you ever since your
                life became nothing more than a perpetual anime binge-a-thon. Fret not my fellow weeb, for below this very
                paragraph there is a button. A very special button. It will provide you with phrases you can use to trick 
                your unsuspecting loved ones into believing you are in fact a succesful member of the workforce. Go, 
                my friend, onwards to victory!
